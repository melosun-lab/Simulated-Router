## Simulated Router

Implemented a router that receives Ethernet frames, IPV4 packets, or ICMP packets and forwards them to the correct outgoing interface, performing longest-prefix matching lookups in the routing table, etc.

Emulated a network topology by running the router on top of Mininet.

Enabled multi-directional Ping and file (50KB ~ 10MB) transfer between clients, hosts, and servers.

Supported checksum verifications, invalid packet handling, Echo-Reply message generation.
